//I was unable to get the MadLibs or the collapsed navbar to work. 

//Peer Reviewer: Alexander Soria  
//Peer Review: The site works nearly as intended. As stated above, the Madlibs doesn't function and while responsive, in mobile versions the collapsed navbar simply lacks its functions. Some of the messages don't display properly if an input doesn't meet the criteria to be valid. Overall, the site works almost as intended, and serves the overwhelming majority of its functions well.
